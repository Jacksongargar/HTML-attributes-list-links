      <p>Amsterdam Van Gogh Museum maintains the world’s largest collection of the works of the world’s <br> most popular artist - Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890),  
       his paintings, drawings and letters, completed with <br> the art of his contemporaries. Each year, 1.6 million visitors come to the Van Gogh Museum,  
       making it <br> one of the 25 most popular museums in the world. In 2015, the museum added the new glass entrance hall <br> at the back of its building.

      <p>The collection features the works of Vincent van Gogh – more than 200 painting, 500 drawings but also works of <br> other artists, his contemporaries – 
       Impressionists and Postimpressionists. Van Gogh's work is organized chronologically into <br> 
       five periods, each representing a different period of his life and work: The Netherlands, Paris, Arles, Saint-Remy and Auvers-sur-Oise.</p>

       <h2>Porto</h2>
       <img src="Images/Porto.jpg" alt="image of the city of Porto" width="650" height="400">
       <p>Opening up like a pop-up book from the banks of the Rio Douro, edgy-yet-opulent Porto entices with its <br> historic center and sumptuous food and wine. Porto is a coastal city in northwest Portugal known for its 
       <br> stately bridges and port wine production. In the medieval Ribeira (riverside) district, narrow cobbled streets 
       <br> wind past merchants’ houses and cafes. São Francisco Church is known for its lavish baroque interior with 
       <br> ornate gilded carvings. The palatial 19th-century Palácio de Bolsa, formerly a stock market, was built to 
       <br> impress potential European investors.</p>

<h2>Bangkok</h2>
<img src="Images/Bangkok.jpg" alt="Van Gogh Museum permanent collection" width="650" height="400">
<p>Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, is a large city known for ornate shrines and vibrant street life. The boat-filled 
  <br> Chao Phraya River feeds its network of canals, flowing past the Rattanakosin royal district, home to opulent 
  <br> Grand Palace and its sacred Wat Phra Kaew Temple. Nearby is Wat Pho Temple with an enormous reclining 
  <br>  Buddha and, on the opposite shore, Wat Arun Temple with its steep steps and Khmer-style spire.</p>
